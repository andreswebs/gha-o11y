# Product Brief: gha-o11y - GitHub Actions Observability App

## Overview

The GitHub Actions Observability App (gha-o11y) is designed to address the lack of visibility and difficulty in improving the performance of CI/CD pipelines. By providing actionable insights and metrics, this product empowers teams to optimize their workflows and make data-driven decisions. The app connects seamlessly to any GitHub repository, collects data using OpenTelemetry, and integrates with any observability platform that supports OpenTelemetry.

This product is tailored for DevOps engineers, technical managers, developers, and CI/CD maintainers who need fast, reliable, and cost-effective pipelines for software delivery.

## Core Features

- **GitHub Repository Integration**: Seamless connection to GitHub repositories to monitor GitHub Actions pipelines.
- **Pipeline Metrics Collection**: Key metrics include:
  - Success/failure rate
  - Duration (workflow, step, waiting for runner)
  - Cost estimation
  - Number of runs, failures, and successes
  - Mean time to production (MTTP)
- **OpenTelemetry Support**: Standardized data collection and instrumentation.
- **Observability Platform Integration**: Export data to any platform supporting OpenTelemetry.

## User Experience

### User Personas

1. **DevOps Engineers**: Focused on optimizing CI/CD pipelines for efficiency and reliability.
2. **Technical Managers**: Interested in high-level metrics to assess team productivity and pipeline costs.
3. **Developers**: Need actionable feedback to improve workflows and reduce waiting times.
4. **CI/CD Maintainers**: Responsible for maintaining and improving pipeline infrastructure.

### Key User Flows

- Connecting the app to a GitHub repository.
- Viewing pipeline metrics and insights in a user-friendly dashboard.
- Exporting data to an observability platform.

### UI/UX Considerations

- Intuitive setup process for connecting repositories.
- Clear visualization of metrics and trends.
- Customizable data export options.

## Technical Architecture

- **System Components**:
  - GitHub App for data collection.
  - OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
  - Integration layer for observability platforms.
- **Data Models**:
  - Metrics schema for pipelines (e.g., success rate, duration, cost).
- **APIs and Integrations**:
  - GitHub Actions API.
  - OpenTelemetry SDK.
  - Observability platform APIs.
- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - Cloud-hosted backend for data processing and storage.

## Development Roadmap

### MVP Requirements
